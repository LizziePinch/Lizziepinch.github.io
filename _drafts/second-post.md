Recently I've been doing lots of colouring. The sheets on this page were printed from the crayola website and are based on songs by a band named "the Beatles". For those of you have never heard of them, they were one of the most famous bands in the 60s. The teenagers, who had never heard music like this before, went crazy for them, and when I was watching a perfomance on youtube, they were in a football stadium because there were so many people in the audience and many of the girls were crying, and another was being slapped round the face by a police because she'd fainted! I love listening to this amazing band because of their brilliant and sometimes crazy music: it just cheers me up. I don't really think I have a favourite song but I do like some more than others.
