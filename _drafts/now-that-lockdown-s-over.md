Now that lockdown's over, pretty much, we are much less limited on what we can and cannot do. Well, mostly cannot do. I have organized a playdate with a friend and I hope it goes better than the one I'm currently having with my neighbours who are playing army with my brother. All of a sudden I'm the enemy, and I want to listen to one song and they want to make me listen to "Barbie Girl!" instead, which is the stupidest song ever! Thankfully I think I've managed to get them to go away. I just want 10 minutes peace. Is that too much to ask? Its al thanks to my brother's stupid toy gun, as well! I wish I hadn't had the silly idea of inviting them over to our house. They're alright outside, kind of, but now I'm just going insane!

Fortunately, I can look forward to seeing my friend tomorrow at her amazing house! Aargh! My neighbours and Thomas just came in carrying Rosie the baby with a glove on her head! Rosie is a toy baby that I've had for what seems like forever, and even though I'm way too old for her, do you think I'm just gonna chuck her in the bin? I take care of all toys, no matter how old I am, and when they said they'd been shooting at her I was very angry, but I didn't retaliate.I just told them to go away, severely. I wish there were some girls who lived next door, but even then I wouldn't cause my brother to go mad, like what is on the brink of happening to me!

Back to my friends house, I'll tell you more about that, but trust me, if they come in again, it will be the death of them. Ahem. My friend's awesome home is a farm, so it has all sorts of animals like geese ducks, chickens and alpacas. Yep, alpacas! And she has lots of gardens to play in. Unfortunately she has lots of sisters as well. Well, only two but they are annoying, but they're only in year one and three so they have an excuse. I've kind of got used to their antics, and they are annoying in a lovable kind of way, and one of them has a boyfriend (they got together on their first day of school- bleugh!) and the other has nearly 6000000. 

My friend also has a pond, and not just a small botanic koi pool.Her fishpond is big enough to go kayaking, and I'll tell you what: it's really fun!
