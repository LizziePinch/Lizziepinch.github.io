I love worms. They're all around us, and we don't notice, as they are hiding beneath the soil! I love the way they seem really chubby, but can stretch themselves to be very long and skinny. The longest earthworm was 61cm! In fact, the minute you started reading this, you probably pictured a classic, pink, wriggly earthworm, but there are thousands of other worms, such as the Christmas tree worm, a type of "segmented" worm,

flatworms, which are both male and female at the same time,

and the rather elusive lugworm, which leaves common wormcats on the beach like these:

According to Wikipedia, "_An earthworm is a terrestrial invertebrate that belongs to the phylum Annelida. They exhibit a tube-within-a-tube body plan, are externally segmented with corresponding internal segmentation, and usually have setae on all segments. They occur worldwide where soil, water, and temperature allow._"
