I love worms. They're all around us, and we don't notice, as they are hiding beneath the soil! I love the way they seem really chubby, but can stretch themselves to be very long and skinny. The longest earthworm was 61cm! In fact, the minute you started reading this, you probably pictured a classic, pink, wriggly earthworm, but there are thousands of other worms, such as the Christmas tree worm, a type of "segmented" worm,

flatworms, which are both male and female at the same time,

and the rather elusive lugworm, which leaves common wormcasts on the beach like these:

According to Wikipedia, "_An earthworm is a terrestrial invertebrate that belongs to the phylum Annelida. They exhibit a tube-within-a-tube body plan, are externally segmented with corresponding internal segmentation, and usually have setae on all segments."_ Earthworms feed on organic decaying matter, such as dying leaves, which helps the circle of life or something. Not only that, but worms are really smart. A good example of that is on rainy days. They always come up to land as their holes run the risk of being flooded, and most birds don't really enjoy the rain.
