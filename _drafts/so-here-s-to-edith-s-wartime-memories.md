I'm sure most of you had a Year 6 end of term production at the end of the year. Ours  is Edith's Wartime Scrapbook by ****** (I did that for copyright reasons). The story is about Edith Coleman who is, I don't know, 80, and is about to go to an old people's home. While she's getting ready, she finds her scrapbook that she had to make during WWII. Edith explains the events in her scrapbook to the removal men. But what are the parts I play? I play:

* Granny, a crazy old lady with horrible soup.
* Adult 7, sitting in the shelter.
* Jiving Girl, a sassy girl, fascinated by the "hot" GIs
* Captain of the army. 

The scenes are:

 1. Scene 1: Coleman family are sitting around the table chatting
 2. Scene 2: Evacuees are leaving at the train station
 3. Scene 3: ARP Wardens are discussing how to keep people safe during the blitz
 4. Scene 4: Adults are sitting in the local bomb shelter
 5. Scene 5: The women are working on the farms and in factories
 6. Scene 6: Dad's army are being comically clumsy
 7.  Scene 7: The sassy girls being fascinated by the GIs
 8.  Scene 8: The captain and soldiers are taking a fighting break
 9.  Scene 9: the Colemans are waiting for Edith's older brother to come home
10.  Scene 10. VE day!

Well, that's the basic summary of it all, and by the way, me and my friends have written a toilet song! Here are the lyrics:

**It's a toilet! By Lizzie, Jasmine and Keona**

I did a really big poo

And flushed it down the loo,

Oho Oh! Oho Oh!

Then I pulled up my pants

And then I went to wash my hands!

Oho Oh! Oho Oh!

**Chorus...**   It's a toilet!

It's a toilet!

It's a toilet!

Down it goes!

 It's a toilet!

It's a toilet!

It's a toilet!

Yes it is!

Then I did a yellow wee

And got some on my knee,

Oho Oh! Oho Oh!

Then I gave it a dry

And then said goodbye!

Oho Oh! Oho Oh!

**Chorus...**   It's a toilet!

It's a toilet!

It's a toilet!

Down it goes!

 It's a toilet!

It's a toilet!

It's a toilet!

Yes it is!

Then I did a big fart

And that was just the first part,

Oho Oh! Oh Oho Oh!

Cause out came a big poo

Who on Earth knew?

Oho Oh! Oho Oh!

**Chorus...**   It's a toilet!

It's a toilet!

It's a toilet!

Down it goes!

 It's a toilet!

It's a toilet!

It's a toilet!

Yes it is!

The End. Goodbye!
