On Monday, my class went on the first school trip we'd been on in months! In light of our World War II topic, we went to an activity centre to do some military-style training! We were split into groups (or platoons (or something)) then we did some different activities: caving, air rifle shooting üëé and bushcraft. I was with my friends üëç and we started with bushcraft, where we started with a game of hide and seek. We had 30 seconds to hide. 

**Round one:** Everyone did their battle cry (wolf howl, squawk, etc) to give the seeker an idea of where to look (the seeker is not aloud to move from where they counted).

**Round 2:** We stick one of our limbs out.

**Round** **3:** We stick our whole body out.

**Round** **4:** We run and high five (or in lockdown's case "elbow") the seeker then sit down.

**If found:** You're out and you have to sit down.

Its as easy as that! After that our group was split in to, and we had to set up tarps, or tarpaulins.

There was plenty of forest we could use, and, although ours was small, it was windproof, personproof and of course, rainproof. It passed the test, although the camouflage (made mostly of undergrowth, or as the others called it, mulch) did fall off quite easily. Then we tried making some fire with flint and steel. Watching the cotton wool burn was very fun to watch!

Then, we got to do one of the coolest thing ever: CAVING
