My name is Lizzie, and I am 11 years old. I have a pet hamster named Peanut, a brother who is nine, and lots of teddies. I like reading, writing drawing and playing video games such as Fortnite, Stardew Valley and Minecraft. I especially love reading comics like Looshkin, Bunny vs Monkey and Sigismond's Neighbourhood, which are all in the Phoenix, which is absolutely brilliant. I love listening to some of the older bands such as Blur, the Beatles and Blondie, which for some reason all begin with B. I also enjoy First Aid Kit, which I think is from Sweden.I love beef, especially when it's covered in gravy and has some crispy roast potatoes beside it. I've never been able to stand cheese; the whole idea puts me off. In addition, I don't like pizza, as that is covered in cheese.
