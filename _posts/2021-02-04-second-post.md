**My first post is one of my stories. As it is quite long, I have only typed a bit of it here. It is called...**

**And What Happened Next?**

Everybody finds it boring when some of your parent’s friends come around, right? Derek did. Until Tuesday, that is. Today Derek told me all about the visit of his Mum’s friend Kelly and her 6-year-old son Leo. It’s quite a funny story actually. This is what happened.

Derek dreaded parents-and-their-friends days. He was treated like some kind of butler. “Make some tea, will you?” His mother would say. “And bring some chocolate Digestives, too, and perhaps a few choccies.” If my Mum was like that, I’d feel the same way as Derek did. But not today. The visit wasn’t as boring as other ones usually are, oh no. Because this woman had something that usually makes friend visits a lot more fun. Kelly was one of Derek’s Mum’s best friends. And Kelly had a kid.

Leo was his name, and he was the complete opposite of calm. He would smash things to bits and let his imagination run wild. And I mean wild. He would paint himself as a superhero fighting Godzilla on the wall then turn Derek’s Mum’s favourite clothes into a superhero outfit. Then he would run around the house yelling at the top of his voice, “LEO MCGREGORY, AKA SAUSAGE DUDE, IS HERE TO SAVE US ALL FROM PERIL!” Derek’s Mum would freak out, and Kelly would chase Leo round the house saying sorry over and over again. But Tuesday was different. No, Leo had not changed his behaviour, but had gone the complete opposite. He was 100% crazier than before. Derek told me that if there was a world cup for craziness, he would win it that day. For that day, he nearly burnt Derek’s house to a crisp!

Kelly received a message on her iPhone that she had to look at. She told Leo to hold her coffee, but then he dropped it on the radiator. The radiator started to smoke, which Leo said, “sounded like silent but deadly farts.” Then without warning, the radiator went up in flames.

**Haha! I, cruelly, have left you on a cliffhanger! We'll find out what happens another time, but for now, goodbye!**
