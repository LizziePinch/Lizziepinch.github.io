I love worms. They're all around us, and we don't notice, as they are hiding beneath the soil! I love the way they seem really chubby, but can stretch themselves to be very long and skinny. The longest earthworm was 61cm! In fact, the minute you started reading this, you probably pictured a classic, pink, wriggly earthworm, but there are LOADS of other worms, such as the Christmas tree worm, a type of "segmented" worm,

flatworms, which are both male and female at the same time,

and the rather elusive lugworm, which leaves common wormcasts on the beach like these:

According to Wikipedia, "_An earthworm is a terrestrial invertebrate that belongs to the phylum Annelida. They exhibit a tube-within-a-tube body plan, are externally segmented with corresponding internal segmentation, and usually have setae on all segments."_ Earthworms feed on organic decaying matter, such as dying leaves, which helps the circle of life or something. Not only that, but worms are really smart. A good example of that is on rainy days. They always come up to land as their holes run the risk of being flooded, and most birds don't really enjoy the rain.

Now let's talk about the Joseph Stalin of all worms: the bobbit (I think that's how you spell it) worm. That may sound like a cute and cuddly name, but check out what it looks like!![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Eunice_aphroditois.jpg)

Right now you might be screaming, "AAAAAARRRRRGGGGGHHHHH! THIS THING'S GONNA KILL US ALL!" And, in spite of it being able to grow up to 10 feet long, the bobbit worm is no threat to humans. But fish? Well, that's a whole different story. Before I tell you anything about that, sing that shark attack song in your head from the film, "Jaws" to make this whole thing sound more dramatic. Imagine you are a small, saltwater fish going about your business, looking for a little bit of algae or something, and you get a bit close to the floor and SNAP! A huge mess of a horns and tentacles EAT YOU UP! Bobbit worms wait for prey in sand or sometimes coral or rocks, before jumping out of their hiding spot for a nice plate of fish and chips. Except without the plate and chips. Sometimes people gathering rocks and coral for pet fish accidentally take one with one of these nightmares still hiding in them, which means, unfortunately, no more pet fish. They also sometimes move the little ornaments and rocks around. But don't worry! Bobbit worms very rarely found in fish tanks and if you did have a bobbit worm, you'd definitely know about it by now!

All the worms I've mentioned are just one in many! But before I conclude this Wormpedia, SLOW WORMS ARE LEGLESS LIZARDS, NOT WORMS! Oh, and you can stop singing that Jaws song now.
