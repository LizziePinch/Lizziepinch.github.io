In my previous home-schooling zoom lessons, I have been doing some poetry inspired by [Joshua Seigal](https://www.joshuaseigal.co.uk/). Enjoy!

**Animal House**

In the living room, a laziness of sloths,

Lounges on the couch,

And a troop of kangaroos, wearing my shoes,

Each have a joey in their pouch.

Unfortunately, there’s a hole in the TV,

From where a crash of rhinos have been,

And an ostentation of peacocks,

Is more beautiful than anything I’ve seen.

My tummy seems to be rumbling,

but there’s nothing here to eat,

I saw a pride of lions sneak away,

Tearing on some meat.

A shiver of sharks whirl around,

In the washing machine,

And a mob of meerkats, share a KitKat,

A truly unusual scene.

In the dining room, I fill with gloom,

As a pandemonium of parrots peck at my bowl,

And a tribe of monkeys, riding a paddling of duckies,

Burn, in the carpet, a hole.

While everything is doing all that,

I notice baboon shaking his bum,

And with my mouth open wide, I have to hide,

When out comes a whole tribe of them.

Upstairs is havoc, and another pandemonium of parrots,

Swoop around the hall,

A boogle of weasels splatter my dad’s easel,

And their picture doesn’t look good at all.

In my room there’s an ambush of tigers,

Hiding in the draw,

Amongst my pile of records, a leap of leopards,

Jump out and do a loud ROAR!

Don’t get me started on the bathroom,

There’s a pack of wolves giving themselves a lick,

And I laugh, when in the bath,

A pod of dolphins go, “Squeak whistle click!”

In the loo, which I think is gross, don’t you?

Buzzes a swarm of bees,

And in the toiletry bag, now frayed like a rag,

I see a mischief of mice nibbling some cheese.

I’m not sure how any of this happened,

But I don’t think I want to know,

Even now, I’m being eavesdropped on,

By a murder of crows.

I don’t know what to say,

And I don’t know what to do,

But none of these collective nouns are made up,

They’re true!

**I Hate Poetry**

I don’t like similes.

Every time I attempt them,

My head spins like a fairground ride,

My fingers tremble like a tumble-dryer,

And my brain melts like an ice-cream on a hot day.

I don’t like metaphors.

Every time I try to think of one,

My brain dissolves into a pile of mush,

My hands turn to stone

And my stomach spins around a hundred times.

I don’t like personification.

Every time I struggle to think of one,

My stomach does a backflip,

My eyes do pirouettes

And my brain runs away.

I don’t like alliteration,

We learn about it at school but,

It’s a manic mess of madness,

A wild whirlwind of wacky words,

And an abominable ball-pit of bedlam.

I don’t like onomatopoeia.

Too much noise.

BOOM, BANG, BLAM!

KABOOM, ROAR, CRASH!

POW, SMASH! WHAM!

I don’t like hyperbole,

Every time I attempt one,

I feel like I am dying,

I must’ve told you a BILLION times,

It’s the WORST THING EVER!

I don’t like idiom.

Every time I try to think of one,

The cat gets my tongue,

It adds insult to injury,

Maybe I should just call it a day?

I don’t like assonance.

Every time I try to write some,

I am faced with slippery trickery,

And it sprays us with chaos,

As I try not to rhyme, I am resigned,

That now this poem should just stop growing!
