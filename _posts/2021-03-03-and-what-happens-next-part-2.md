**Hello! Remember** [**a few days ago**](\\bizzles.me\\2021-02-04-second-post "a few days ago") **I revealed a story I'd written and finished on a cliffhanger? Well all will be revealed... right now! Oh, and if you need reminding of what what happened before, a 6 year old named Leo came round to a 10 year old boy called Derek's house and set the radiator on fire.**

Everyone evacuated the building, as the fire was spreading fast. Kelly called 999, and soon after they could hear the siren of the fire engine. Leo adored it, because he wanted to be a fireman when he grew up, and I think that that’s one of the world’s most dangerous jobs to have, but not Leo. As soon as it came into Leo’s view, he was screaming his head off in excitement.

As soon as the fire engine’s engine had stopped, Leo lifted up the hose, switched it on to POWERFUL, then made a hole in the wall. And what happened next? He spotted the ladder. Leo climbed onto the roof of the fire engine and began to climb the ladder. Kelly and Derek’s mum were swearing their heads off. Derek was watching Leo in amazement and Leo? He was halfway up the ladder already! The firemen, who were not out of the fire engine yet, had no idea what was going on. Seeing as he was thirsty Leo sprayed the hose into his mouth, which is obviously super unhygienic.

Then when the firemen were out and putting out the fire, Leo crept into the driver’s seat, and what happened next? He blared the horn, switched on the siren and began to drive off.

Now Kelly and Derek’s Mum were discussing running away to Russia, or Australia, or the Amazon Rainforest to give themselves a rest.

Derek hopped on his bicycle and whizzed along the road. I actually saw a boy riding a bike chasing an out-of-control fire engine, and that doesn’t happen very often, so it was easy to believe when he told me all this.

It was a while until he caught Leo, and when Leo returned home, he was in whopping great trouble. He was shoved in the car and grounded for life. Poor Leo. But mostly, poor Derek.

**And there you have it! A tale of calamity, chaos and radiators on fire.**
