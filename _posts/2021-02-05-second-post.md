Recently I've been doing lots of colouring. The sheets on this page were printed from the crayola website and are based on songs by a band named "the Beatles". 

For those of you have never heard of them, they were one of the most famous bands in the 60s. The teenagers, who had never heard music like this before, went crazy for them, and when I was watching a perfomance on youtube, they were in a football stadium because there were so many people in the audience and many of the girls were crying, and another was being slapped round the face by a police because she'd fainted! 

I love listening to this amazing band because of their brilliant and sometimes crazy music: it just cheers me up. I don't really think I have a favourite song but I do like some more than others. 

The four Beatles are all very different. The singer, Paul, the other singer, John, the lead guitarist, George and the drummer Ringo, although they each have slightly different personalities are all equally brilliant. 

Although they're not as good as the songs, they have some good films too, such as Yellow Submarine and Magical Mystery Tour, which are both very surreal. 

My favourite "album" is an orange CD with a big yellow 1 in the middle. I listened to it so much when I was younger I can remember the next song everytime one from the album comes on! Many of their songs are about love, which makes me think that they get into trouble with lots of different ladies because I am not sure if they're singing about the same one all the time! 

Although I listen to so much other music, this has to be one of my favourite bands of all time.
